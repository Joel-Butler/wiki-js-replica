It has been quite some time since we put something up. There hasn't been a lot of stuff to share duing the pandemic, we'd kept busy with work and managed through as best we could. 

I remember reading a short poem by Aussie Poet [Cameron Semmens](https://www.webcameron.com/) that talks about taking pleasure in the little mundane events that happen through the day, and I feel like this time was filled with pretty much *only* the mundane while we waited for things to get better.

I figure we've all heard enough about hard times so I thought I'd focus on the positives that happened over the last year:

* Attending Tae Kwon Do classes via video worked pretty well, although a lot of that was due to the effort our club Master put in to coach and train remotely, and to learn all the patterns in mirror image for us!
