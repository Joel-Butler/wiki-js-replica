# React Native
I've opted to use React Native as the platform to run the client side application as with Javascript as the engine of choice for the server-side, this simplifies my process by allowing a common language across the entire application. 

Like most foundational frameworks React does have a lot to learn beyond the underlying language in order to use effectively so this page will house my notes as I learn.

Initial sources for Learning:
* [React Native's Documentation](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
* [React JSX documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html)
