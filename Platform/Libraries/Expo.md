# Expo
Notes on devloping with Expo.

## Online Documentation:
* [Getting Started](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/)

## Overview
Expo provides a *"Ruby on Rails"-like* experience when developing phone apps. The framework uses React Native which allows for a simpler approach to developing a solution across multiple devices.

On top of that the expo application allows a handy way of prototyping live on several devices. 

I'd agonized over whether to fall back to building from scratch rather than leveraging a framework, but for [my first application](/Apps/FamilyLocation/Overview), where the focus is on the server-side microservices, and I want a relatively simple but functional client application this will be a good starting point for rapid prototyping.

Pros: 
* Built-in support for background tasks involving geolocation and geofencing.
* Live deploy/debug process allowing for rapid prototyping.

Once I have the prototype working I can then consider whether the framework is well suited for futher development.
