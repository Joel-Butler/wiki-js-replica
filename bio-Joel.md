Hi! This page has a little bit about Joel (me) and what I do.

I've been working in IT since early 2004, and while my areas of expertise began in infrastructure and networking, I've become a bit of a generalist over the years; comfortable with most things from hardware to application code, but without the deep knowledge that many years of focus can bring. 

These days I work in IT portfolio management, helping to drive Agile efforts at scale, and I use this space to journal the things I work on at home to keep some of the broader skills I have fresh. 

Having spent most of my life on the East Coast of Australia, My family and I have now moved over to Massachusetts in the US in late 2017. [Our blog has a bit more on that journey](/Blog)
