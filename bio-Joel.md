Hi! This page has a little bit about Joel (me) and what I do.

I've been working in IT since early 2004, and while my areas of expertise began in infrastructure and networking, I've become a bit of a generalist over the years; comfortable with most things from hardware to application code, but without the deep knowledge that many years of focus can bring.

These days I work as a Development manager, helping enable software engineers to deliver great web products. 

I currently live in Brisbane, Australia. My family has travelled a bit and [Our blog has a bit more on that journey](/Blog)
