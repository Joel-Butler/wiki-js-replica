# Unity Overview
I've created this new area to journal some of the work in testing out some unity and AI scripting I've been interested in starting. 

After playing a fair bit of X4 I was fascinated with the idea of an actor-driven simulation where things could evolve in all kinds of directions based on both how the environment was generated and how each individual 'actor' made their decisions through the simulation.

That kind of broad and complex simulation is *way* beyond what I'm capable of right now though, so I thought I'd start with some simple concepts and learn some Lua scripting along the way.

I'd picked Unity as my platform of choice because of its easy entry point and my existing familarity with C#. I feel like any really well optimized platform for simulation may need to go the way of a lower level language for optimized run, but that would also require developers who can write code that is tightly optimized at that level... and that isn't me :-).
