## Overview
My objective here was to build out a first pass at a simulation that was low-effort enough that I could get it up and running in a day.

Key objectives:
* Produce something that works.
* Inject some basic Lua scripts and get some ideas for how to separate system and actor code so that modifying the latter is simple and potentially can be done in-game.
* Visualize the simulation using some *really* ***really*** basic visuals.
