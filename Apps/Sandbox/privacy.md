# Privacy
The sandbox app is purely for testing and prototyping. Information captured here is diagnostic in nature and can include:
* Who you are - if you authenticate to this app via a valid OAuth Source - limited to the level of identity the source provides.
* Your IP address.
* That's about it really. 

Data will be stored locally until I remember to delete it, which may be a while.
