# Location System Privacy Policy

Information the application collects:
* Your Google Identity (for the purpose of authentication and tagging your data.
* Your Geodata movements through the day (for the purpose of sharing this information within the family circle, and allowing notifications on departure/arrival). 

This particular release is intended for personal use only by willing participants of my immediate family, with geodata housed onsite. Opting in/out of sharing data between family members or removing any stored history can be managed by contacting me directly at joel@jhbutler.info, but to be honest, if you are not a family member you really shouldn't be attempting to use this application at all.
