It has been quite some time since we put something up. There hasn't been a lot of stuff to share duing the pandemic, we'd kept busy with work and managed through as best we could. 

I remember reading a short poem by Aussie Poet [Cameron Semmens](https://www.webcameron.com/) that talks about taking pleasure in the little mundane events that happen through the day, and I feel like this time was filled with pretty much *only* the mundane while we waited for things to get better.

I figure we've all heard enough about hard times so I thought I'd focus on the positives that happened over the last year:

* I got to hang with the family way more than usual - and the kids are growing up so quick!

* We managed to keep up [training Tae Kwon Do](https://www.koreatkdnatick.com/) through the pandemic thanks to all the effort our club Master put in to coach and train remotely, and to learn all the patterns in mirror image for us!

* I finally found a use for those sewing lessons I had to take in high school (I made some masks :-)).

* I got through a backlog of video games I was hoping to play. 
* Eating out was trickier so we ate in: A highlight of each week was turning saturday morning into a cool breakfast/brunch setup where each week I'd try to outdo myself in making a bigger and better breakfast wrap with all kinds of extras.

As things got a little more under control the two highlights for me were getting back to [Jiu Jitsu](http://www.sonecabjj.com/), and finally getting back into the office (and out of my bedroom - which had been my temp office for quite a while).

Heidi recently got a new job working for Sodexo at Bose, which has been really nice as now we can car-pool to work together. 

With things starting to look like they might settle down it's been really nice to do more of those little mundane things that were just part of our daily or weekly routine again.

I'd like to think that this time might help me better appreciate those little things for how precious they are. I'll probably end up just taking them for granted again one day soon, but for now they are a glorious fragment of life that I'm glad to have back!
