## Looking back
We arrived in the US just before the thanksgiving holiday in 2017.  Heidi and I were hoping the kids would handle the adjustment quickly and not quite realizing just how much work was ahead, or how it was really her and I that had the adapting work to do. Kids just seem to figure it all out. 

It has certainly been an interesting three years. We've learned a lot about this country, our own family's ability to adapt to a new environment and some of our limits. 

Given all the stuff that has happened I'm proud of what we've achieved individually and as a little family unit so far. I'm hopeful that we'll be able to do a bit more 'adventuring' in this country again soon. 

## Adapting to the pandemic
The pandemic has certainly shaken the globe but with the stark difference in how the US and our home country of Australia have been able to handle the spread of the virus, it makes for some interesting conversations with friends and family back home.

The kids have been coping quite well, they miss the stuff we no longer do.

We still get some regular exercise in with Tae Kwon Do but I think I need to take them for more regular walks as they both managed to get worn out after a quick stroll around the block recently. On the plus side they are doing well at school and coping okay with much more time at home.

If we lost the internet I believe that might be a bit more challenging.

Heidi and I are coping for now, but like most people I think we're looking forward to the end of all the changes this has introduced. Until that time comes we'll adapt as best we can. 

## Fall walks in the park
Autumn (Fall) is nearly over here and most of the leaves have turned from green to gold, and then to brown. They now either carpet the pathways or have been swept up and put away to stop excitable animals, children, or the odd adult (big children) from making a mess.

I took James through Ghiloni park yesterday as he seems to love stomping through the leaves, and there was a ton of them along the paths through the small woodland area. He got a bit tired out, but I think he had fun.
